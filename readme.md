## Install

```
$ hyper install hyper-9009
```

## Explanation
The idea behind the theme was inspired from both [GMK 9009](https://dixiemech.com/shop/gmk9009) and [hyper-snazzy](https://github.com/sindresorhus/hyper-snazzy). It was originally an experiment of showing printing colors on terminal, and it turns out to be okay. To make your terminal aligned with the screenshot, [pure-9009](https://github.com/RichoHan/pure-9009) is recommended (also a modified version of [pure](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure)). Note that most of work was done by the original author [Sindre Sorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus) and relative team members.  

For all colors used in the theme, please check the table below.
